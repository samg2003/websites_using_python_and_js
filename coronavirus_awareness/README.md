# FinalProject

For this Project i have create a mobile responsive web site using django for growing awareness of Coronavirus
it gives live data of number of cases of coronavirus using https://covid2019-api.herokuapp.com/docs API
this api closed 6 hours a day so my website will not give data and show concerned message.
it also has user responsive symptoms and quiz page which is single page applications using javascript
